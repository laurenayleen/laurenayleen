## Hello!!

### My name is Lauren Sanders and I am currently a full time student at ASU studying Graphic Information Technology (Full-stack Web Development). My goal for my education is to land a job in UI/UX Design someday. I also currently work for Microsoft as a specialist in sales development and coaching. I enjoy a mix of technology and business in my work, and I am excited for what this semester has in store. When I am not busy, I am spending time with my two cats, Onyx and Smokey (pictured below) as they make every day more enjoyable and exciting. Thanks for stopping by!
